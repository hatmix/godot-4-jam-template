# Godot 4 Jam Template

Quick start template for game jams built on [hatmix/godot-4-ci](https://github.com/hatmix/godot-4-ci). See the plain template in action at [https://hatmix.itch.io/godot-4-jam-template](https://hatmix.itch.io/godot-4-jam-template) (password `hatmix`).

Features:
* Github template repository vs. addon
* Web, Windows, Linux and macOS exports configured for maximum jam
* Premade basic UI for main menu, pause menu, credits, and settings
* [G.U.I.D.E](https://godotneers.github.io/G.U.I.D.E/) for input with remapping
* Settings persisted across sessions (where `user://` filesystem is writable)
* Keyboard and controller support for all template UI and touchscreen via [Godot's emulate mouse from touch setting](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_projectsettings.html#class-projectsettings-property-input-devices-pointing-emulate-mouse-from-touch)
* ATTRIBUTION.md for in-game credits (inspired by [Maaack](https://github.com/Maaack/Godot-Game-Template/blob/main/ATTRIBUTION.md)'s approach)
* CI/CD for automatic Itch.io updates adapted from [abarichello/godot-ci](https://github.com/abarichello/godot-ci)
* [TODO Manager](https://github.com/OrigamiDev-Pete/TODO_Manager) included and todos added for setting up a new project

Don't just settle for the first template you find! Compare the alternatives and decide which best fits your desired feature set, coding style, and approach to game development.

## Initial setup

There are a few ways to get started.
* "Use this template"
* Clone the repository
* Download a zip file of the source

## Main

Once the Godot project files are cloned locally, open `res://main.tscn` and `res://main.gd` and create your game!

## UI

Most of this template's work is done in the UI scenes under `res://ui/...`.  The main UI scene treats its direct children as UI pages and components to show or hide. They might be an entire screen or just a widget in the corner. The main UI scene includes basic UI for all of the template's menus, a stub in-game UI with pause screen, and Maaack's [`ProjectUISoundController`](https://github.com/Maaack/Godot-UI-Sound-Controller).

The intended approach is to keep all UI in `res://ui/ui.tscn` and instantiate it as a child of every other scene.

The top-level UI is set `PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS` with children inheriting the mode. The `InGameMenuOverlay` will appear when `get_tree().paused == true`. In games where pausing the tree should not hide the game area, either remove that node or have the `PauseMenu` show and hide the overaly.

The project default theme is `res://ui/ui_theme.tres` generated by [ThemeGen](https://github.com/Inspiaaa/ThemeGen) and `res://ui/ui_theme.gd`.

## Folder structure

Each UI layout is contained in its own directory under `res://ui`. The `assets` folder is for non-scene/non-code files used in the UI. The `game` folder and its scene are intended for the UI (HUD) shown in gameplay only and I recommend creating a `res://game` directory to hold other game files.

## Settings and Controls

Settings are saved automatically in `user://settings.cfg` and control mappings in `user://controls.tres`. Saving and loading are handled by `res://autoloads/settings.gd`.

See [G.U.I.D.E documentation](https://godotneers.github.io/G.U.I.D.E/) for how to add new actions, etc.

The input icons are generated by G.U.I.D.E in a RichTextLabel. The buttons used for remapping use the theme generated by `res://ui/controls/remap_input_button_theme.gd`.

## TODO

Stay organized with TODO and FIXME comments in scripts and markdown files. Add your own options per [TODO Manager](https://github.com/OrigamiDev-Pete/TODO_Manager)'s documentation.

## Tests

GUT addon has been removed. I hope to have [gdUnit4](https://github.com/MikeSchulze/gdUnit4) tests working with CI soon.

## CI/CD

[Github actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) can be used to publish to itch.io on every push.

On succesful export, and if configured, the CI action uses [butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/) to deploy the game to [itch.io](https://itch.io).  Setup these secrets in your Github repository to enable push:
* ITCHIO_USERNAME
* ITCHIO_GAME
* BUTLER_API_KEY
